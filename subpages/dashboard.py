    ## **Understanding the Relationship Between Traffic and Air Quality**
    This visualization explores how **traffic-related pollutants** impact overall air quality across cities.

    ### **Graph 1: NOâ‚‚ vs AQI**
    - **X-Axis:** Nitrogen Dioxide (NOâ‚‚) levels  
    - **Y-Axis:** Air Quality Index (AQI)  
    - **Insight:** Since NOâ‚‚ is a key emission from vehicles, an upward trend in AQI with rising NOâ‚‚ levels may indicate that **traffic congestion contributes to poor air quality**.

    ### **Graph 2: CO vs AQI**
    - **X-Axis:** Carbon Monoxide (CO) levels  
    - **Y-Axis:** Air Quality Index (AQI)  
    - **Insight:** CO is another traffic-related pollutant. If AQI increases with CO levels, it suggests **vehicular emissions significantly impact air pollution**.

    ### **Key Takeaways**
     Helps assess how vehicle emissions impact overall air quality.  
    Identifies whether **stricter traffic control measures** could improve air conditions.  
     Supports decision-making for **urban planning and pollution control policies**.

    **This analysis enables us to better understand and mitigate the effects of traffic on air pollution!** ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

    ## How Seasons Impact Air Quality
    This visualization examines how AQI varies across different seasons, helping to identify trends in air pollution.

    ### Graph Overview
    - **X-Axis:** Seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn)  
    - **Y-Axis:** Average Air Quality Index (AQI)  
    - **Insight:** The variation in AQI across seasons helps identify periods of high and low pollution levels.

    ### Seasonal Trends
    - **Winter:** Often the worst season for air quality due to temperature inversion trapping pollutants.  
    - **Spring:** Moderate air quality as weather transitions.  
    - **Summer:** Generally better air quality due to higher wind speeds dispersing pollutants.    
    - **Autumn:** Pollution levels start rising due to post-monsoon temperature drops and crop burning in some regions.  

    ### Key Takeaways
    - Helps predict seasonal air pollution levels.  
    - Identifies when air quality worsens, allowing for preventive measures.  
    - Supports government policies on pollution control for high-risk seasons.  

    This analysis provides useful insights into how AQI fluctuates throughout the year.
